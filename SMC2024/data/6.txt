Reasoning:
1 more accurately captured my pulse. It knew where I was going. 2 and 3 were less precise. Sometimes they guessed I was going to go faster, but I did not intend to go faster.

4 human

5 human and 6 computer because 6 did not follow correctly.
It is not possible to tell the difference through articulation etc., only by the difference of timing.

7 computer. Because the fast notes sound rushed. It doesn't sound like someone who is unfamiliar with the score. The key noise did not correlate with what we heard.


Comments:
When it plays melody, it would be nice to have the melody phrases more defined. Sometimes the melody breaks in the middle of the phrase.
