Reasoning and comments:

2: more constant tempo, a little bit slower, worse accompaniment
3: speed adjustment too extreme

5,6: mistrial, because forgot

8: melody phrasing more natural than 7

10: in the middle suddenly became faster

It would be better to not block the view, because one can accompany better when one sees the other.

Average confidence: 7/10
