Reasoning:
2 definitely computer because a human should be better at catching the melody and adjusting when it goes wrong.
Between 3 and 1: 3 followed me better. 1 felt like a backing track.


4 human because the sound is very even, like it has gone through training.
5 and 6 sound like they sometimes get stuck. Like it is capturing what I play and processing it. It is applying a force on me, while 4 is smooth and lets me play like I want.

8 human because similar to 4. Quickly was able to follow me.

9 computer because it was bad. And the key noise did not align with what I hear.

11 computer because it made a mistake. And it is overly precise. Not singing. 

12 human because there was no obvious non-alignment. This was well together.
The melody had a singing feeling. 50% confidence.

Confidence 70% except last one and first one.

JH: I felt that someone was following my music. I didn't play too stable. When I played soft, it was soft together, loud=loud together. There was breathing.
