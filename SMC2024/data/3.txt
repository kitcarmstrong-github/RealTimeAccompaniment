Reasoning:
5 computer because of errors and not together.
6 expression was better. 5 was a bit stiff, even before it lost alignment. 6 felt like more interaction. It was more interesting.

7 more primitive dynamics. Like MIDI with constant velocity. I think person will make more changes. But it could be a human because I thought I heard it play a wrong note.

7 (Yi-Wen) human, because no failures noticed. 

8 human because of large dynamics changes.
